# BIT BY BIT - All Text Content

## Tutorial Messages

### First Launch
```
WELCOME TO BIT BY BIT

You are about to discover the fundamental nature of information itself.

Click the accumulator to generate your first bits - 
the smallest unit of information.

[CLICK TO BEGIN]
```

### After First Click (5 bits)
```
💡 TIP: Manual Generation

Clicking generates bits, but you'll soon want 
automated sources.

Buy your first Random Number Generator to start 
passive generation.

[OK]
```

### First Generator Purchase
```
✓ GENERATOR ACQUIRED

Your Random Number Generator produces 1 bit per second
through pure entropy - maximum uncertainty, maximum
information.

Accumulate 100 bits to unlock your next generator.

[NICE!]
```

### Unlock Upgrades Tab (1,000 bits)
```
🔬 NEW FEATURE: UPGRADES

You've unlocked the upgrade system! Upgrades provide
permanent bonuses that persist through rebirths.

Check out Entropy Amplification - it doubles ALL
production.

[GOT IT]
```

### Approaching First Rebirth (50 MB)
```
⚠️ EFFICIENCY WARNING

You're generating massive amounts of data, but most
of it is redundant. The information content is much
lower than the raw bit count.

Keep pushing toward 128 MB to unlock COMPRESSION.

[UNDERSTOOD]
```

### First Rebirth Available (128 MB)
```
🌀 COMPRESSION UNLOCKED

You've discovered that information can be COMPRESSED.

By compressing your 128 MB of raw data, you'll:
• Lose all bits, generators, and upgrades
• Gain 7 Compression Tokens
• Enter the Compression Era with new mechanics

This is a "prestige" or "rebirth" - you reset to
grow stronger.

Ready to compress?

[NOT YET]  [COMPRESS NOW!]
```

### Post-Rebirth Welcome
```
🎉 WELCOME TO THE COMPRESSION ERA

You're now working with COMPRESSED bits - each one
represents true information content.

Your new generators are compression algorithms. They
produce compressed data but generate overhead.

Efficiency matters now. Keep overhead low!

[LET'S GO]
```

### Unlock Compression Tokens
```
⭐ COMPRESSION TOKENS

These golden tokens are permanent meta-currency.

Spend them on powerful upgrades that persist through
ALL future rebirths.

Choose wisely - tokens are precious!

## Generator Flavor Text

### Entropy Era

#### Random Number Generator
```
"Pure chaos. Maximum entropy. One coin flip at a time."

The most fundamental source of information - complete
unpredictability. Each bit is truly random, containing
exactly 1 bit of information.
```

#### Biased Coin
```
"Not all outcomes are equal. Less surprise, more data."

When the coin lands on heads 70% of the time, each flip
contains ~0.88 bits of information. Predictability reduces
entropy, but data generation increases.
```

#### Dice Roller
```
"Six possible states. log₂(6) ≈ 2.58 bits per roll."

A fair six-sided die produces 2.58 bits of information per
roll. More states, more information - but still discrete,
still random.
```

#### Deck Shuffler
```
"52! permutations. Astronomical entropy."

A shuffled deck has 52 factorial possible arrangements.
That's about 226 bits of information in a single shuffle.
Combinatorial explosion at work.
```

#### Noise Generator
```
"White noise. Every frequency, equal power."

Thermal noise from quantum fluctuations. The universe's
own random number generator, producing truly random bits
from fundamental physics.
```

#### Thermal Sensor
```
"Brownian motion. The universe's random number generator."

Measuring the random jitter of molecules in motion. Maximum
entropy from minimum predictability - nature's chaos engine.
```

### Compression Era

#### Run-Length Encoder
```
"AAAAAAA becomes 7A. Simple patterns, simple gains."

The simplest compression algorithm. Replaces repeated
sequences with count + symbol. Effective on low-entropy
data with long runs.
```

#### Huffman Tree
```
"Common symbols = short codes. Optimal prefix-free encoding."

Builds a binary tree where frequent symbols get short codes.
Provably optimal for symbol-by-symbol encoding. Created by
David Huffman in 1952.
```

#### LZ77 Dictionary
```
"Already seen this sequence. Backreference: (distance, length)."

Invented by Lempel and Ziv in 1977. Replaces repeated
sequences with pointers to earlier occurrences. The foundation
of ZIP, GZIP, and PNG compression.
```

#### Arithmetic Coder
```
"Encode entire message as a single number in [0,1)."

Maps messages to intervals on the number line. Asymptotically
optimal - approaches the Shannon entropy limit. Used in JPEG
and modern video codecs.
```

#### Context Mixer
```
"Predict next bit from weighted context history."

Maintains multiple context models and adaptively weighs their
predictions. State-of-the-art compression for text and certain
data patterns.
```

#### Neural Compressor
```
"Learn the data manifold. Reality has structure."

A neural network learns the underlying structure of data,
then compresses based on learned patterns. The frontier of
compression research.
```

## Upgrade Descriptions

### Entropy Amplification
```
ENTROPY AMPLIFICATION

Multiplies ALL production by 2×.

Each level doubles your total output. At max level,
you'll have a 1,024× multiplier.

Current: ×[CURRENT] → Next: ×[NEXT]
```

### Click Power
```
MANUAL GENERATION

Increases click value by +10 bits per level.

Early game only - once you have idle production,
clicking becomes obsolete. Don't over-invest.

Current: +[CURRENT]b per click
```

### Sampling Rate
```
SAMPLING RATE

Increases update frequency - production ticks faster.

Level 1: 1 tick/second (default)
Level 2: 2 ticks/second
Level 3: 4 ticks/second
Level 4: 10 ticks/second

Smoother numbers, faster compounding. Quality of life.
```

### Compression Ratio (Token Upgrade)
```
⭐ COMPRESSION RATIO

Reduces overhead generation by 5% per level.

This is THE most important meta-upgrade. Every point
here means more efficiency, more net production.

Buy early, buy often.

Current: -[X]% overhead
```
