# **BIT BY BIT - Game Design**

## **Core Theme: Information Theory**
You're not just collecting data—you're discovering the fundamental nature of information itself. Each rebirth represents a paradigm shift in how information can be encoded, compressed, and transmitted.

---

## **PHASE 1: Pre-Rebirth (Entropy Era)**

### **Primary Currency: Raw Bits**
The fundamental unit of information. Everything generates bits per second (bps).

### **Buyable Generators** (Information Sources)

1. **Random Number Generator** (Cost: 10 bits)
   - Generates: 1 bps
   - *"Pure chaos. Maximum entropy. One coin flip at a time."*

2. **Biased Coin** (Cost: 100 bits)
   - Generates: 8 bps
   - *"Not all outcomes are equal. Less surprise, more data."*

3. **Dice Roller** (Cost: 1,200 bits)
   - Generates: 100 bps
   - *"Six possible states. Log₂(6) ≈ 2.58 bits per roll."*

4. **Deck Shuffler** (Cost: 15,000 bits)
   - Generates: 1.5 kbps
   - *"52! permutations. Astronomical entropy."*

5. **Noise Generator** (Cost: 200,000 bits)
   - Generates: 25 kbps
   - *"White noise. Every frequency, equal power."*

6. **Thermal Sensor** (Cost: 3,000,000 bits)
   - Generates: 400 kbps
   - *"Brownian motion. The universe's random number generator."*

### **Upgrades** (Pre-Rebirth)
- **Entropy Amplification**: Increases all generation by 2x (costs scale exponentially)
- **Parallel Processing**: Each generator type gains +10% per purchase
- **Sampling Rate**: Click power increases (manual clicking generates bits)

### **The Wall**
Around 100 MB, progress slows dramatically. You realize you're generating *redundant* information. Most of your bits contain no new knowledge. You need **compression**.

---

## **REBIRTH MECHANIC: Compression**

### **Trigger Condition**
Accumulate 128 MB of raw data to perform your first **Compression Cycle**.

### **What Happens**
- You lose ALL bits, generators, and upgrades
- You gain **Compression Tokens** based on total bits ever generated
- Formula: `Tokens = floor(log₂(total_bits_lifetime) - 20)`
  - 128 MB (2²⁷ bits) = 7 tokens
  - 1 GB (2³⁰ bits) = 10 tokens
  - 10 GB (2³³ bits) = 13 tokens

### **Revolutionary Change: You now generate COMPRESSED data**

After rebirth, you're in **Compression Era**. Everything works differently:

---

## **PHASE 2: Post-Rebirth (Compression Era)**

### **New Currency Dual System**
- **Compressed Bits** (primary) - worth 1 bit of *information content*
- **Overhead** (secondary) - inefficiency in your compression

### **New Generators** (Compression Algorithms)

1. **Run-Length Encoder** (Cost: 5 compressed bits)
   - Generates: 2 compressed bps
   - Overhead: 0.5 bits/sec (from headers)
   - *"AAAAAAA becomes 7A. Simple patterns, simple gains."*

2. **Huffman Tree** (Cost: 80 compressed bits)
   - Generates: 20 compressed bps
   - Overhead: 2 bits/sec (from frequency table)
   - *"Common symbols = short codes. Optimal prefix-free encoding."*

3. **LZ77 Dictionary** (Cost: 1,000 compressed bits)
   - Generates: 300 compressed bps
   - Overhead: 15 bits/sec (from dictionary maintenance)
   - *"Already seen this sequence. Backreference: (distance, length)."*

4. **Arithmetic Coder** (Cost: 15,000 compressed bits)
   - Generates: 5 kbps compressed
   - Overhead: 200 bits/sec (from precision limits)
   - *"Encode entire message as a single number in [0,1)."*

5. **Context Mixer** (Cost: 250,000 compressed bits)
   - Generates: 80 kbps compressed
   - Overhead: 4 kbps (from context models)
   - *"Predict next bit from weighted context history."*

6. **Neural Compressor** (Cost: 4,000,000 compressed bits)
   - Generates: 1.5 Mbps compressed
   - Overhead: 80 kbps (from model parameters)
   - *"Learn the data manifold. Reality has structure."*

### **Compression Tokens**
Spend tokens on permanent meta-upgrades:
- **Compression Ratio**: Each token = 5% better compression (reduces overhead generation)
- **Lossless Guarantee**: Unlock ability to convert overhead back into compressed bits
- **Parallel Streams**: Run multiple compression algorithms simultaneously
- **Adaptive Learning**: Generators automatically improve based on data patterns

### **The Second Wall**
Around 10 GB compressed, you hit diminishing returns. Your compression is near-optimal, but you're still moving data *sequentially*. You need **channel capacity**.

---

## **SECOND REBIRTH: Channel Theory**

### **Trigger**: Compress 16 GB of data

### **Revolutionary Change: Parallel Channels**

Now you're not just generating bits—you're transmitting them through **noisy channels** with limited capacity.

### **New Mechanics**
- **Shannon Limit**: Each channel has max theoretical throughput
- **Error Correction**: Spend bits on redundancy (Hamming codes, Reed-Solomon)
- **Multi-path Routing**: Split data across channels with different noise characteristics
- **Signal Processing**: Filter noise, amplify signal

### **New Generators** (Communication Channels)

1. **Binary Symmetric Channel**
2. **Gaussian Channel**  
3. **Burst Error Channel**
4. **Fading Channel**
5. **MIMO Array** (Multiple Input Multiple Output)
6. **Quantum Channel**

Each has bandwidth, noise level, and unique properties affecting throughput vs reliability tradeoffs.

---

## **THIRD REBIRTH: Quantum Information**

### **Trigger**: Transmit 1 TB through channels

### **Revolutionary Change: Qubits**

- **Superposition**: Generators create bits in probabilistic states
- **Entanglement**: Link generators to share information non-locally
- **Decoherence**: Time pressure mechanic—qubits collapse if not measured
- **No-Cloning Theorem**: Can't copy quantum states, only transform them

New strategic depth: *when* you measure matters as much as *what* you generate.
