### Tutorial Start
**Objective**: Teach clicking and basic concept

**Step 1: Welcome**
```
WELCOME TO BIT BY BIT

You are about to discover the fundamental 
nature of information itself.

Information is measured in BITS - the smallest
unit of data, representing a single choice.

[CONTINUE]
```

**Step 2: First Click**
```
YOUR FIRST BIT

The accumulator below represents raw information.
Each click generates 1 bit of random data.

Click the accumulator 5 times to begin.

[ 0 / 5 BITS GENERATED ]
```

**Step 3: Click Success**
```
✓ GENERATION COMPLETE

You've generated your first 5 bits!
Each bit represents a random binary decision:
0 or 1, heads or tails, on or off.

But clicking gets tedious quickly...

[NEXT]
```

## Phase 1: Introduction to Generators

### Teaching Automation
**Objective**: Introduce passive generation concept

**Step 1: Generator Introduction**
```
AUTOMATION DISCOVERED

Meet your first generator:
Random Number Generator

It produces 1 bit per second automatically.
Clicking becomes optional, not required.

Buy your first generator for 10 bits.

[BUY RANDOM GENERATOR - 10b]
```

**Step 2: First Generator Success**
```
✓ AUTOMATION ACTIVE

Your Random Number Generator is now running!
Notice the production bar - it shows
bits per second.

Each new generator becomes more powerful
but also more expensive.

[UNDERSTOOD]
```

**Step 3: Progress Milestone**
```
MILESTONE REACHED: 100 BITS

You're generating information automatically!
But one generator isn't enough.

Accumulate 100 bits to unlock a new type
of generator with different mechanics.

[KEEP GOING!]
```

---

## Phase 2: Generator Variety

### Unlocking New Options
**Objective**: Teach generator diversity and strategy

**Step 1: Second Generator Unlock**
```
NEW GENERATOR UNLOCKED!

Biased Coin
┌─────────────────────────────────────┐
│ Production: 8 bits/second           │
│ Cost: 100 bits                      │
│                                     │
│ "When outcomes are predictable,     │
│ information decreases, but data     │
│ generation increases."              │
└─────────────────────────────────────┘

It's 8x stronger than your first generator!
Is it worth the higher cost?

[BUY BIASED COIN - 100b]  [LATER]
```

**Step 2: Strategy Introduction**
```
GENERATOR STRATEGY

Now you have choices:
• Buy more of your first generator (cheap, weak)
• Buy the new generator (expensive, strong)
• Balance between both

There's no wrong answer - experiment!

[GOT IT]
```

**Step 3: Cost Demonstration**
```
COST MECHANICS EXPLAINED

Notice how generator costs increase:
1st RNG: 10 bits
2nd RNG: 12 bits  
3rd RNG: 14 bits

This is geometric growth - each costs more
than the last. Same for all generators.

[CONTINUE]
```

## Phase 3: Introduction to Upgrades

### Teaching Permanent Improvements
**Objective**: Introduce upgrade system

**Step 1: Unlock Upgrades Tab**
```
🔬 UPGRADES UNLOCKED!

Reaching 1,000 bits has unlocked the Upgrade tab.

Upgrades provide PERMANENT bonuses that:
• Stack with each other
• Help all generators
• Persist through rebirths

Your first upgrade is Entropy Amplification.

[VIEW UPGRADES]
```

**Step 2: First Upgrade Purchase**
```
ENTROPY AMPLIFICATION

Multiplies ALL your production by 2×

Cost: 1,000 bits
Effect: Double your current output
Current: 150 b/s → 300 b/s

This is your most powerful upgrade yet!

[BUY UPGRADE - 1,000b]  [SAVE BITS]
```

**Step 3: Upgrade Success**
```
✓ UPGRADE ACTIVE!

All your production is now doubled!
Future upgrades will stack with this one.

Notice how clicking and generators both
benefit from upgrades.

[AMAZING!]
```

## Phase 4: Advanced Concepts Introduction

### Teaching Complexity Gradually
**Objective**: Prepare for rebirth mechanics

**Step 1: Efficiency Concept**
```
💡 INFORMATION DENSITY

You're generating lots of bits, but how much
INFORMATION do they actually contain?

Most of your data is redundant patterns,
not unique information.

This concept becomes important soon...

[INTERESTING]
```

**Step 2: Stats Introduction**
```
📊 STATISTICS UNLOCKED!

At 100 KB, you've unlocked detailed statistics.

Track:
• Total bits ever generated  
• Current production rate
• Time played
• And more...

Stats help you understand your progress.

[VIEW STATS]
```

**Step 3: Save System**
```
💾 AUTO-SAVE ACTIVE

Your progress automatically saves every 30 seconds.

You can also manually save or export your game
from the settings menu.

Never lose your information!

[GOT IT]
```

## Phase 5: Rebirth Tutorial

### Teaching the Core Loop
**Objective**: Introduce compression/rebirth mechanics

**Step 1: Rebirth Warning**
```
⚠️ APPROACHING LIMIT

At 50 MB, you're generating massive amounts of data.
But most is redundant information.

Keep pushing toward 128 MB to discover
how to make this data meaningful.

[UNDERSTOOD]
```

**Step 2: Rebirth Unlock**
```
🌀 COMPRESSION DISCOVERED!

You've unlocked the ability to COMPRESS your data!

By compressing 128 MB of raw bits:
• You lose all current progress
• Gain 7 Compression Tokens ⭐
• Unlock new mechanics and generators

This is a "prestige" - reset to grow stronger.

[LEARN MORE]  [TRY LATER]
```

**Step 3: Rebirth Tutorial**
```
COMPRESSION EXPLAINED

Compression removes redundancy from data,
leaving only meaningful information.

WHY REBIRTH?
• Token upgrades are permanent
• New era has unique mechanics
• Progress becomes much faster

FIRST REBIRTH is optional but recommended.

[READY TO COMPRESS]  [CONTINUE PLAYING]
```

---

## Phase 6: Post-Rebirth Tutorial

### Teaching New Era
**Objective**: Introduce compression mechanics

**Step 1: Welcome to Compression Era**
```
🎉 WELCOME TO THE COMPRESSION ERA!

You're now working with COMPRESSED bits.

NEW CONCEPTS:
• Generators produce compressed data
• They also generate overhead (waste)
• Efficiency matters now
• Compression tokens buy permanent upgrades

This era requires more strategy!

[START LEARNING]
```

**Step 2: Efficiency Tutorial**
```
⚖️ EFFICIENCY MECHANICS

Efficiency = compressed / (compressed + overhead)

Your first generator:
• Produces 2 compressed bits/second
• Generates 0.5 overhead bits/second
• Net efficiency: 80%

Keep efficiency high for maximum progress!

[UNDERSTAND EFFICIENCY]
```

**Step 3: Token Upgrades**
```
⭐ COMPRESSION TOKENS

You have 7 tokens to spend on permanent upgrades:

COMPRESSION RATIO (-5% overhead) - 2 tokens
PARALLEL STREAMS (extra generator slot) - 3 tokens  
ADAPTIVE LEARNING (time-based bonus) - 5 tokens

Choose wisely - tokens are precious!

## Phase 7: Advanced Tutorial Elements

### Teaching Player Agency
**Objective**: Encourage exploration and discovery

#### Strategy Tips (Optional)
```
💡 STRATEGY TIP #1

Don't spend all tokens on one upgrade!
Balance Compression Ratio with other bonuses
for best results.

[DON'T SHOW TIPS]  [NEXT TIP]
```

#### Feature Highlights
```
✨ NEW FEATURE: BULK BUYING

Hold Shift while buying generators to buy 10 at once.
Hold Ctrl to buy max affordable.

Makes managing many generators much easier!
